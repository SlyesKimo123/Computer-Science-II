String: A string is a sequence of characters.  Strings can be modified but not changed --- they are immutable. A string is a useful tool for gathering inputs.
List: A series of data, separated by commas inside a set of brackets.  A list can be indexed in order to change certain things in the list of gather information.  Lists are mutable.
Tuple: A tuple is a series of data, separated by commas inside a set of parentheses.  A tuple is immutable, unlike a list.  Tuples are useful for storing a series of similar data (like colors or names, for example) so that they can be called upon later (at random).
